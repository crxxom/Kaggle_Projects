# First Kaggle notebook

My first kaggle notebook which is a data analysis/visualization/EDA notebook on video games sales since 1980. This is also my first time where I take my knowledge of libraries such as pandas and matplotlib into action. 
I also manage to learn some of the basics of Tableau from the competition also and built a dashboard out of it.
