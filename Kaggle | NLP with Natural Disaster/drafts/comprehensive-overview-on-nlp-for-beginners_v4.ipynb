That's why I have created a NLP tutorial series to split the content in this notebook into several parts. The content in this notebook and in the series is almost identical, feel free to choose to use this notebook or to learn with the series if it suits your learning need. (Tips: You can download this notebook as a note for future referencing and learn with the tutorial series)\n\nHere are the links to the whole series:\n     \n**✅ Comprehensive Overview on NLP for Beginners 🥳 (collection of all series)** <br>\n https://www.kaggle.com/code/crxxom/comprehensive-overview-on-nlp-for-beginners\n \n    \n**🔴 NLP Beginner Series Part 1: NLP Preprocessing** <br>\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/crxxom/nlp-beginner-series-part-1-nlp-preprocessing\n\n**🟡 NLP Beginner Series Part 2.1: Word Embeddings** <br>\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/crxxom/nlp-beginner-series-part-2-1-word-embeddings\n\n**🟢 NLP Beginner Series Part 2.2: Embedding Models** <br>\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/crxxom/nlp-beginner-series-part-2-2-embedding-models\n\n**🟣 NLP Beginner Series Part 3: Case Study** <br>\n https://www.kaggle.com/code/crxxom/nlp-beginner-series-part-3-case-study","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:40px;\"><span style=\"color:#3A506B\">🔥  Overview of the Notebook  🔥</div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## >> Important concepts and techniques you need to know to get you started with NLP explained in a **➡ beginner friendly way ⬅**\n\n## >> **ONLY** pre-requisite you need: Python, Pandas and Numpy\n\n## >> 🕑 Take your Time! (~ 2-3 hours)\n\nThe estimated time to complete this notebook can be between 2-3 hours if you are a beginner. It can take even longer if read the additional resources and do other research while surfing through the notebook. There is no need to rush the process! In fact, it is recommended to split the workload to a few days for a more comfortable and effective learning. But I can guarantee you your time will be well spent if your an absolute beginner!\n\n## >> Is this notebook for me 🤔\n\nThis notebook **covers the absolute fundamentals of NLP to let you have an overview with what exactly is NLP and how it work.** \n\n### 🌟 Skim through the notebook\n\nQuickly scroll through the whole notebook to see if the style suit your learning needs!\n\n### 🌟 This notebook is beginner friendly\nThis notebook is very much a **beginner friendly notebook**, the only pre-requisite you will need is Python and some common data science frameworks such as Pandas and Numpy. All the concepts covered in this notebook will be clearly explained but may not be deeply explained, you will be encouraged to do additional research on your own if you would like to understand more about a particular topic. The goal of this notebook is to give you an overview to NLP and introduce you with key vocabularies and concepts you will need to know in NLP.\n\n\n### 🌟 Seperate sections to suit your needs\n**Each section of the notebook is seperated**, ie. you do NOT need to run the code on section 1 to be able to run the code in section 2, libraries and framework will be introduced and imported in each individual section, dataset are not interrelatble across sections. If you are only interested in any particular section, **you can skip through the sections to run the code in that particular section only**. In fact, I try to make each codeblock as seperated as possible so that you do not need to run codeblock A to be able to run B.\n\n\n### 🌟 Images to help you learn\nThis notebook contains **a lot of images** to demonstrate the concepts and principles as I find it to be the best way to understand complicated concepts. These images are mostly images from google and screenshots from youtube tutorials, if any parties find it inappropriate to use their images/screenshots, please let me know I will delete is as soon as possible.\n\n### 🌟 I am a beginner also\nThis notebook is **written from the perspective of a beginner** to the world of machine learning. With that being said, there may be some concepts that isn't covered clearly/deeply, but on the other hand, I feel like it will be easier to catch up if you are a beginner as well, as I will not be throwing some complicated jargons and overload you too much since I am a beginner as well. Additionally I have also included a lot of resources if you want to have a deeper insight for each topics.\n\n\n### 🌟 Notebook designed in a way to not overwhelm you\n**Take your time!** Small and lengthy words are hard and dull to read, that's why this notebook trys to **minimize the amount of text and use bold text, images and emojis** so that you can navigate the notebook faster. The notebook also attempts to **minimize the amount of code** as much as possible, to save you from being too overwhelmed. \n\n**Try to run the codeblocks youself**, running and changing codes in the codeblocks can give you a more immersive learning experience. \n\nIf you appreciate my work or would like to express your views/make suggestions on some of my code and content, feel free to comment and correct me, I will make sure to keep updating and make improvements to this notebook! I hope you will find this notebook useful and an enjoyable journey.\n\n## 🔎 Concepts and techniques you can take away with you from this notebook\n\n#### 🟢 [Overview of NLP Pipeline](#nlp-pipeline)\n\n#### 🟢 [Tokenization and spaCy pipeline](#tokenization)\n\n#### 🟢 [Stop Word](#stop-word)\n\n#### 🟢 [Stemming and Lemmatization](#stemming-and-lemmatization)\n\n#### 🟢 [Out of Vocabulary (OOV)](#out-of-vocabulary)\n\n#### 🟢 [POS (Part of Speech) tagging](#part-of-speech-tagging)\n\n#### 🟢 [Name Entity Recognition (NER)](#named-entity-recognition)\n\n#### 🟢 [Bag of Words (BOW)](#bag-of-words)\n\n#### 🟢 [Bag of n-grams](#bag-of-n-grams)\n\n#### 🟢 [Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)](#tf-idf)\n\n#### 🟢 [Word Embeddings](#word-embeddings)\n\n#### 🟢 [Cosine Similarity](#cosine-similarity)\n\n#### 🟢 [Arithmetic of Word Embeddings](#arithmetic-of-word-embeddings)\n\n#### 🟢 [Continuous Bag of Words Model](#cbow)\n\n#### 🟢 [SkipGram Model](#skipgram)\n \n#### 🟢 [Word2Vec](#word2vec)\n\n#### 🟢 [fastText](#fasttext)\n\n#### 🟢 [GloVe](#glove)\n\n#### 🟢 [Hugging Face](#huggingface)\n\n#### 🟢 [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)](#bert)\n\n#### 🟢 [Case Study: NLP with Disaster Tweet](#case-study)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YmCSFRs.png\" style=\"height:500px;\"> </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/buymiQ8.png\" style=\"height:500px;\"> </div>","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T07:39:21.603523Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T07:39:21.604021Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T07:39:21.612542Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T07:39:21.603985Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T07:39:21.610742Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id=\"nlp-pipeline\"></a><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:40px;\"><span style=\"color:#3A506B\">Overview of NLP Pipeline</span></div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Jm6yryM.png\" style=\"height:250px;\"> </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1️⃣ Data Collection\n* Collection of raw data to train the model\n* Typical NLP data examples are text data such as reviews from amazon, tweets on twitter or news articles from google news\n \n### 2️⃣ Text Cleaning\n* Common text cleaning tasks are removing special characters, removing HTML tags, removing extra lines and space etc.\n* Often involve the use of **regular expression** (it's basically a technique to input a sequence to extract a pattern in a sentence, it is not a machine learning thing but more like a python thing)\n\n### 3️⃣ Preprocessing\n* The point of preprocessing is to transform our dataset in a way that allow our model to better grab the key information and value of our input data\n* A lot of techniques and concepts will be covered in this section including,\n* **Tokenization**\n* **Stop word**\n* **Stemming and Lemmatization**\n* **POS tagging**\n* **Name Entity Recognition (NER)**\n\n\n### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering\n* In NLP, feature engineering process mostly involve **vectorizing** words (converting strings into meaningful numbers), techniques and concept covered in this section including,\n* **Bag of Word (BOW)**\n* **Bag of n-grams**\n* **Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**\n* **Word embedding**\n* **Cosine Similarity**\n* **CBOW and SkipGram**\n* **Word2Vec**\n* **GloVe**\n* **fastText**\n* **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)**\n\n### 5️⃣ Modelling\n* Examples of models commonly used for NLP tasks are Naive Bayes and deep learning algorithms like LSTM\n\n### 6️⃣-8️⃣ Evaluation, Deployment and Monitoring and model updating","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id=\"tokenization\"></a><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:40px;\"><span style=\"color:#3A506B\">🌟 Tokenization with spaCy 🌟</span></div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ia7NSZy.png\" style=\"height:300px;\"> </div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"❗ *Tokenization is used in natural language processing to **split paragraphs and sentences into smaller units** that can be more easily assigned meaning.

It is often **used as a weighting factor** in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling.*\n\nWhen talking about TF-IDF, we have to introduce some math and statistical concept to better illustrate the concept. But don't get scared, the maths in TF-IDF is relatively easy so stay with me.\n\nLet's break TF-IDF into two parts, term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).\n\n## Term Frequency (TF)\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RhnP5xc.png\" style=\"height:120px;\"> </div>\n\nThis look a little overwhelming, to put the mathematical equation in words,\n\n`Term Frequency(TF) = number of times the word appeared / total no of words in a document`\n\n### ✍ Example: \n\nThe best way to learn is always through examples, so let's see an example with this sentence\n\n>> **\"Natural Language Processing is fun Machine Learning is fun\"**\n\n❓ Question: Find the term frequency of the word *'is'*\n\n✅ Total number of word in the document: 9 <br>\n✅ number of times *is* appeared in the text: 2 <br>\n🟰 TF(is): 2/9 \n\nSimilarly, TF(Machine) is what, yes your right, 1/9.\n\n🌟 If you think deeper, the range of possible value of TF is 0 to 1, when TF is closer to 1, it means that the word appear more frequently in the text.\n\nNow let's move on to Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\n## Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AvZkDVx.png\" style=\"height:150px;\"> </div>\n<br>\n\nTo put it in words,\n\n`Inverse Document Frequency(IDF) = log(Total number of documents (rows) / Number of documents (rows) containing the word)`\n\n### ✍ Example: \n\nLet's see IDF in action with an example, imagine we have 2 documents (rows) \n\n>> **1. \"Natural Language Processing is fun Machine Learning is fun\"** <br>\n>> **2. \"This is the best thing I ever had\"**\n\n❓ Question: Find the inverse document frequency of the word *'is'*\n\n✅ Total number of documents: 2 <br>\n✅ Number of documents containing the word *is*: 2 <br>\n🟰 IDF(is): log(2/2) = 0\n\nSimilarly, IDF(Machine) will be log(2/1) which is around 0.7 (note: we usually like to use the natural logrithm log base of e in machine learning and statistics)\n\n🌟 If you think deeper, the range of value of IDF is 0 to infinity, but really, if you notice from the example above, what we are doing is to give a smaller weighting to words that appear more frequently across all the documents. Now you see why this is the perfect replacement to simply removing all the stop words, we are achieving similar outcome in a more statistical and robust approach!\n\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SBwxNWb.png\" style=\"height:300px;\"> </div>\n\n## TF-IDF\n\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7RDG6tk.png\" style=\"height:200px;\"> </div>\n\n<br>\n\nNow that you understand the concept of TF and IDF, TF-IDF is relatively simple idea.

Word embedding is a very important concept in NLP which is basically a way to 'vectorize' words into word vectors (if you don't know what's a vector, imagine it as a one dimensional array).\n\nBut the concept of word embedding is not simply to assign a random vector to a word, but assign the vector to each word in a way so that words of similar meaning will have a similar vector and have a closer distance in the vector space.\n\nIn fact, techniques we have mentioned just now like [TF-IDF](#TF-IDF) is in fact a form of word embedding, but this section and the following sections will focus on more advance and complex word embedding strategies and methods particularly involving deep learning. \n<br>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jsSEAHK.png\" style=\"height:300px;\"> </div>\n\n<br>\n\nBut before we dive into the concepts and theory of word embeddings its related concepts and techniques like cosine similarity, I want to take another approach and show you how a word vector look like using spaCy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🧑‍💻 Let's code ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import spacy\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_lg\")\n\ndoc = nlp(\"Natural Language Processing is fun asdasdasd\")\n\nfor token in doc:\n    print(f\"Does the word {token} have a vector in spacy? {token.has_vector}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-08T09:29:03.195667Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-08T09:29:03.196184Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-08T09:29:10.082748Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-08T09:29:03.196143Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-08T09:29:10.081783Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Vector of the word \"Natural\"\ndoc[0].vector","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-08T09:30:03.753705Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-08T09:30:03.754170Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-08T09:30:03.768803Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-08T09:30:03.754134Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-08T09:30:03.766293Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"doc[0].vector.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-08T09:30:27.348014Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-08T09:30:27.348445Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-08T09:30:27.357332Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-08T09:30:27.348411Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-08T09:30:27.355821Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In fact, it is very common for word vector to have a length of 300.\n\nNow you might be confused, where does the vectors come from?

It is often used to measure document similarity in text analysis.*\n\n### The content of this section is heavily inspired by this video by \n\n### StatQuest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9U0QAFbfLI \n\n### It is highly recommended that you watch this 10 minutes video for awesome animations and a more detailed explanations. Below will be an extraction of content from the video.\n\nOne of the main feature of cosine similarity is that it is a metric that can be used regardless of how large and high dimension the dataset is, that is, we can still compute the angle between two words no matter how many words and dimensionality there are, unlike other metrics such as the Euclidean distance approach (calculate distance btween two points) which may not work well when the dataset and dimension is huge. \n\nBefore we dive into the maths, let's see a very simple example to let us have an intuitive understanding of how cosine similarity work with the following example from the StatQuest video.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ✍ Example (Image and example taken from the StatQuest video)\n\nIn particular, let us explore how do we find the cosine similarity between the phrase \"Hello\" and \"Hello World\". \n\n**1.

It is trained using a **feedforward neural network** where the **input is a set of context words, and the output is the target word**.*\n\n\n### 🚨 Important\n\nBefore we move on to how the neural network work, it is a very important concept that you understand that the word embeddings are a **SIDE PRODUCT** of our neural network. In general, the underlying principle of CBOW is that we \n\n#### **create a fake problem** ➡ **solve it using neural network** ➡ **get the word vectors as side products**\n\nIn CBOW, the 'fake problem' is that we try to use neural network to predict a word. In particular, we try to predict the target word from a set of context words. Let's take an example based on the image shown.\n\n### ✍ Example\n\n> **I like to eat apple**\n\n>> **Input**: I, like, eat, apple <br>\n>> **Target output**: to\n\nSo basically in our neural network, there will be four inputs which are 'I', 'like', 'eat', 'apple' (in terms of vector) and then they will be passed through the hidden layer and predict the word 'to' (in terms of vector). The neural network will not predict the right outcome base off the first try, so the neural network will take some kind of metrics (loss) to calculate the error and use a technique call backpropagation to keep repeating the process to adjust the weight and bias to keep getting a closer step to the right output. In the end, the weight and bias is the 'side product' which is the word embedding we want to obtain. \n\nConfusing right? Don't worry, here is an example taken from this video from the channel codebasics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQwFeIupNP0 \n\nIn the example, we try to predict the word 'king' from the phrase 'king ordered his minister'\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LnIQP0r.png\" style=\"height: 300px;\"> </div>\n\n<br>\n\nNow we pass the input to the neural network,\n\n<br>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yucngTz.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\"> </div>\n\n<br>\n\nThe concept is that we will keep training the model again and again by adjusting the weights (image below) and bias connecting different layers and in the end, the weights obtained will be our side product, the word embeddings of the word 'king'\n\n<br>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NmJkzsm.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\"> </div>\n\n<br>\n\nI hope I have explained the concept clearly, if you still don't understand clearly, check out the video I attached above, codebasics definitely did a better job in explaining the idea than I did.

It is just some **fancy model and algorithm that give us the word embeddings as side product** which is what we care about. \n\nOne thing to note that I did not include any coding part in this section since like I mentioned in the beginning, this is a beginner friendly notebook that aims to give you an overview on the topic and I do not want to future complicate this by introducing more complex frameworks and stuff like that.

I enjoy flying** <br>\n\nAnd we contruct the count matrix/co-occurance matrix \n\n<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MMKYOLp.png\" style=\"height: 300px;\"> </div>\n\n<br>\n\nBefore we move on to illustrate how each value is being assigned, we should first understand the concept of **context window**, which is a specified range of tokens surrounding a target token within a text or sequence. In fact, you probably have come across with this concept in the [bag of n-grams](#bag-of-n-grams) and [CBOW](#cbow) sections. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the above example, we are using a context window of 1, take 'like' in the first sentence as an example\n\n> **I** *like* **deep** learning\n\nWhen we use a context window of 1, we look for one token in front of our current word and one token after the current word, in this case, it will be **I** and **deep**. In this case, we will +1 to the corresponding entries in our co-occurance matrix, for the pair ('I', 'like') the corresponding entries will be X\\[1,2\\] and X\\[2,1\\]. But why is the number in the image 2 instead of 1? This is due to the fact that we also add 1 to this pair in our second sentence\n\n> **I** *like* **NLP**\n\nThat explains how the co-occurance matrix is being contructed.\n\nNote: Usually we use a higher context window such as 5 or more, if a context window is 5, we will be adding words from 5 words before the current word and 5 words after the current word.\n\nThis also give you some intuitive understanding of how GloVe cluster words together using the appropriate vectors. **The more two word appear together within a context window, the more they will get grouped together in a vector space.**\n\nThere are a lot more behind the algorithm of GloVe in which I plan to make a seperate notebook to explain GloVe in details in the future.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🧑‍💻 Let's code \n\nI have installed glove6b100dtxt model from kaggle for you to use it directly in this notebook.

But have you ever come across a situation where **the same word have different meaning in different sentences**? If you ran the algorithm with those models, it will return the same embedding for the same word, regardless of their **contextual meaning**.\n\nFor example,\n\n> **'set is an important concept in mathematics'** <br>\n> **'peter just bought a set of lego'** <br>\n> **'This is a set of equipments'**\n\nIn the above example, we human know that the 'set' from the first sentence is very different from the 'set' in the second and third sentences. BERT is a model which can give us a different embedding for the same word based on the context, which is really powerful thing in NLP.\n\nApart from BERT being able to generate contextualized embedding for words in different context, **BERT can also assign embedding to a sentence instead of just assigning embeddings to tokens**, which is something really handy when dealing with tasks such as search engine etc.\n\nThe working principle behind BERT is pretty complicated, which involve the architecture of transformers and concepts of encoders. These concepts will not be explained in this notebook since I personally found it to be not very beginner friendly, and in fact, I myself do not have a deep understanding to the topic as well as in for now.
