    "This notebook is very much a **beginner friendly notebook**, the only pre-requisite you will need is Python and some common data science frameworks such as Pandas and Numpy. All the concepts covered in this notebook will be clearly explained but may not be deeply explained, you will be encouraged to do additional research on your own if you would like to understand more about a particular topic. The goal of this notebook is to give you an overview to NLP and introduce you with key vocabularies and concepts you will need to know in NLP.\n",

If you are only interested in any particular section, **you can skip through the sections to run the code in that particular section only**. In fact, I try to make each codeblock as seperated as possible so that you do not need to run codeblock A to be able to run B.\n",

With that being said, there may be some concepts that isn't covered clearly/deeply, but on the other hand, I feel like it will be easier to catch up if you are a beginner as well, as I will not be throwing some complicated jargons and overload you too much since I am a beginner as well. Additionally I have also included a lot of resources if you want to have a deeper insight for each topics.\n",

    "**Take your time!** Small and lengthy words are hard and dull to read, that's why this notebook trys to **minimize the amount of text and use bold text, images and emojis** so that you can navigate the notebook faster. The notebook also attempts to **minimize the amount of code** as much as possible, to save you from being too overwhelmed. \n",

    "#### **create a fake problem** ➡ **solve it using neural network** ➡ **get the word vectors as side products**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CBOW, the 'fake problem' is that we try to use neural network to predict a word. In particular, we try to predict the target word from a set of context words. Let's take an example based on the image shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✍ Example\n",
    "\n",
    "> **I like to eat apple**\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Input**: I, like, eat, apple <br>\n",
    ">> **Target output**: to\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically in our neural network, there will be four inputs which are 'I', 'like', 'eat', 'apple' (in terms of vector) and then they will be passed through the hidden layer and predict the word 'to' (in terms of vector). The neural network will not predict the right outcome base off the first try, so the neural network will take some kind of metrics (loss) to calculate the error and use a technique call backpropagation to keep repeating the process to adjust the weight and bias to keep getting a closer step to the right output. In the end, the weight and bias is the 'side product' which is the word embedding we want to obtain. \n",

    "Confusing right? Don't worry, here is an example taken from this video from the channel codebasics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQwFeIupNP0 \n",

But it is important to note the GloVe does not use [CBOW](#cbow) nor [SkipGram](#skipgram) to train, instead it uses another training methology call **global matrix factorization** which analyze the global co-occurrence statistics of words in a corpus to learn the word embeddings. Let's see a very simple example as demonstration.\n",

    "❗ *BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is **based on Transformers**, a deep learning model in which every output element is connected to every input element, and the weightings between them are dynamically calculated based upon their connection.*\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is an extremely powerful model in the sense that **it can 'understand' contextual meaning** and assign each word with a unique **contextualized embedding** based on the context of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we have introduced multiple word embedding techniques and models such as Word2Vec and GloVe. But have you ever come across a situation where **the same word have different meaning in different sentences**? If you ran the algorithm with those models, it will return the same embedding for the same word, regardless of their **contextual meaning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "> **'set is an important concept in mathematics'** <br>\n",
    "> **'peter just bought a set of lego'** <br>\n",
    "> **'This is a set of equipments'**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we human know that the 'set' from the first sentence is very different from the 'set' in the second and third sentences. BERT is a model which can give us a different embedding for the same word based on the context, which is really powerful thing in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from BERT being able to generate contextualized embedding for words in different context, **BERT can also assign embedding to a sentence instead of just assigning embeddings to tokens**, which is something really handy when dealing with tasks such as search engine etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The working principle behind BERT is pretty complicated, which involve the architecture of transformers and concepts of encoders. These concepts will not be explained in this notebook since I personally found it to be not very beginner friendly, and in fact, I myself do not have a deep understanding to the topic as well as in for now. With that being said, if anyone can share some good resources in helping us to understanding more about transformers and BERT model, it will be great if you can share with us through commenting on this notebook!\n",
