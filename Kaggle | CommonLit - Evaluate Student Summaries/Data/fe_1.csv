Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.

Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts.

239,1ec6c7f88443,39c16e,"           Aristotle believes there are certain elements that come together to produce an ideal tragedy. He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy.

293,25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'.

First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3).

Though he stresses many ideas, they all fall into general elements that must be included, which includes the actions must spark pity and fear, the change in fortune should be from good to bad, and this shift shouldn't be due to one's bad habits rather from an error of judgment or frailty. Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn't a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",3.6262817507338,2.20429441467864,289,5.788944723618091,2.275824244703523,47,1.2159621480660223,4

Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Orestes and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",3.3699912226066697,3.89794064266612,641,6.402061855670103,1.9087376206593958,76,1.1473633254735394,9

718,57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy.

The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win).

In paragraph 2, he states, ""...imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...""  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness.

The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy.

This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""

Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good.

When discussing a tragic character, Aristolte states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it arouses fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.""

The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3).

In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

Character is the second most essential element of an ideal tragedy. The hero must begin the tragedy by embracing feelings of happiness. As the tragedy progresses, there must be a shift from happiness to misery, ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" The hero should be painted in a good way. In addition, the plot must always demand that of a tragic action which can be addressed with innocence or absolute awareness.

In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion.

Aristotle believed this because any other character would not satisfy the moral sense of pity or fear, as a character that is most similar to the audience would be most relatable and ideal. Lastly, Aristotle thinks that the cause of the main character's downfall should be from a fatal mistake or error. This is also to humanize the main character as it shows that the protaganist makes mistakes like everybody else.

Early on, Aristotle establishes that the main point of a tragedy is to make the audience feel fear and pity, which requires a certain main character. This character must not be perfect or sinister. That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions.

Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3).

This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up.

Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad.

Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune.

He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""

The pharaoh directed an army  in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict stated on paragraph 3. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh. Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh's warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine stated on paragraph 3.

When the students were given the oppurtunity to feel superior to their peers, they took it without a second thought.

[...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.

Moreover, he encouraged them even more to join by creating a catchy motto that read, ""Strength through discipline, stregth through community, strength throught action, strength through pride"" ( The Third Wave 1).

(3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.

Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclar incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process.

It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.""

This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick.

To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers.

In the text it says the meat couldn't be used for anything else so sausage was their last resort. Another way they covered up spoiled meat was by using chemicals. In the text it says ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of picle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This goes to show chemicals played a role in the process, but not only did they make it into sausage and use chemicals, they also would pump the meat. Over time the factory gained control over a second pickle one much stronger than the first and this one got rid of the odor of the meat completely making the price rise thiry cents because the meat didn't smell. Although the meat was already contaminated and spoiled enough, they even furthered and used the skin of the oldest hogs.

After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely unsanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""unspoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat.

6293,91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"".

This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4).

The meat industry used soda to mask the smell and sold the meat on open counters causing more disease. Soda could have worn off and the company could have possibly be sued. The industry could have also used pickle juice or some other type of smell. ""To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor,"" ( paragraph 2). They used pickle juice to pump into the ham which was spoiled and covered up the smell. They could have possibly used another type of smell to mask the odor and this destroyed the odor. The meatpacking industry could be giving anyone spoiled meat and they would never even know. ",1.06240233850106,1.00436524153774,178,5.696,1.88573723580501,24,0.9982247051520794,3

The meatpacking industry was cheat in the since that conserving money was more important than the well-being of the costumers that purchased the sausage that contained the spoiled meat. The author also mentioned the chemistry that went into cleaning the meats, ""... any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose"" (Sinclair par. 2) When if the meat was spoiled the company could chemically enhance it to take away any smell, color, or rotten taste.
