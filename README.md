# A collection of my Kaggle project/competitions

As a self-taught data scientist, Kaggle offers a great place for me to practice my data analysis skills and put my knowledge of machine learning in practice. 

I started my journey of self learning data science and machine learning with Python since around the beginning of 2023, and I would like to show my sincere gratitude to all the support given by this wonderful community with all their wonderful resources and tutorials.

Titles: Kaggle Dataset Expert, Kaggle Notebook Expert
